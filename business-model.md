Optimize for world **happiness**:

-   if your project is:
    - **open source**, you get **all** features for **free**
    - **closed source**, you **may** have to **pay** based on repository size / number of compiles
-   **support**: we are **installable locally** for free and we sell **technical support**.
-   **book sale**. Authors can sell books, and we take a small percentage of their profit.
-   we will stay almost entirely **open source** forever, so that anyone can contribute with great features.
