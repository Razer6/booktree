# Text development with Version control

Definition: *text* can be either: textbook, tutorial, paper, legal document, ...

## Summary

1. **every single** software project uses version control.
1. **text is similar to computer code**: a bunch of characters put together
1. **there is no good enough tool** for version control for text
1. it is **easy** to adapt existing version control tool to text
1. it is **hard** to convince authors to use new tools, even if better

Conclusion: huge **efficiency gains** are behind a **small technological barrier**,
and a **big sociological barrier**.

## Make society richer

Increase the **quality / cost ratio** of text.

Usage cost can be **reduced to 0** for **huge projects**, created by thousands
and used by millions: Firefox, LibreOffice, Linux, Apache, jQuery, GNU ...

The same can happen for text.

Why people contribute for free:

1. to **become famous** and get better jobs
1. they use the project and want to **improve it for their clients**

## Text is cheaper than video

Many MOOCs and websites like Kahn Academy, give emphasis to videos.

However, videos have **larger associated costs** than text to:  
create, modify, search inside, transmit and store.
