# Use cases

## Definition: to become more famous

At certain points, the clause "to become more famous" shall be used
to describe the motivation behind an someone's action.

This is the exact reason as why Facebook or Stack Overflow work:
people do things so that they can get improve automated metrics like
Stack Overflow reputation Facebook likes.

Which in the case of learning material can lead to better jobs, like
for GitHub and Stack Overflow, such fame leads to better jobs and thus more money.

At those points, there may also be legal obligations for users to take certain actions:

- teacher paid to answer student
- article co-worker obliged to write his part

People will also take action for fear of losing their jobs or other reprimands.

At those points, the system can also allow for a direct monetary transaction
between users to increase the speed at which something is done, thus creating
a legal obligation for action.
E.g., an user can pay another to solve an issue through the system itself,
like in bounty systems such as [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com).
