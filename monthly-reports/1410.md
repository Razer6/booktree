# Competition

## WriteLaTeX

-   <http://www.thebookseller.com/news/futurebook-innovation-awards-shortlists-unveiled>

    WriteLaTeX gets another prize.

    I get the impression WriteLaTeX has better connections with the big boys,
    and puts more effort into politics.

    Hard to say if that's the way to go, or to only on the product itself. Might be.

-   New intern: Desislav Hristov, Queen Mary student, totaling 4 people.

## Authorea

Confirmed some notable WONTFIXes on the project issue tracker:

- Side-by-side preview: <https://www.authorea.com/issues/270>
- git push and clone: <https://www.authorea.com/issues/266>
- merge requests: <https://www.authorea.com/issues/18>

## Penflip

-   <https://twitter.com/madebyloren/status/517041167062413314>

    Penflip looking for co-founders.

    Unclear if the team went up.

## GitHub

-   @schacon shows continuous interest in Atlas:

    - <https://github.com/schacon/atlas-api>
    - <http://forum.atlas.oreilly.com/users/schacon/activity>

    Is GitHub gonna move and kill us all? Probably just some pre-screening for now.

## Amazon

-   <https://writeon.amazon.com/>

    Not direct competition since focus on fiction and no collaboration,
    but considerable since done by a giant.
