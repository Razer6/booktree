# History

This project has been created by [Ciro Santilli](http://www.cirosantilli.com) in 2013-10,
due to his dissatisfaction with the current learning method in schools and universities.
He has worked on the project full time since it's creation.

An electrical engineer with only limited web development knowledge,
Ciro has had to learn all the relevant techniques such as Rails and the frontend standards,
which explains the slow development process in the first months.

He is currently the only major contributor, and is looking for investments
to help the project move forward.
