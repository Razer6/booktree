Every software developer today uses version control programs Git, SVN or Mercurial
and their web interfaces like GitHub or Google Code.

Programmers have written great open source software just to be useful and become more famous:
Linux kernel, GNU, jQuery.

Web interfaces reduce the software creation cost and make programmers more visible.

GitHub has had 100M investment in 2012 and has 3M users.

GitHub is free for public projects

We believe it should also be used for writing textbooks and tutorials.

# What are versions

Suppose you want to change a mathematical notation for an entire book for a better one.

- edit file 1, update the notation
- edit file 2, update the notation
- create a new version named: `Update notation.`.

Now you want to add a new example for a theorem:

- edit file 2, add the example
- create a new version named: `Add example.`.

They make it easy to:

- return to an older version if an error was made.
- view the exact differences between two versions.
    - before you create a new version: did I alter anything I shouldn't have?
    - if someone makes a modification to your 

# Web interfaces

Web interfaces are websites like [GitHub](https://github.com)
that use version control systems behind the scenes,
and make it easier for teams to collaborate on a single project.
