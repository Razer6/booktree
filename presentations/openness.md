Openness

This project is committed to openness,
which makes it suitable for funding concerned with this principle:

- the goal of this project is to incentive the creation of cheaper,
    and where possible free learning and scientific data

- everything we make will be MIT licensed forever

- we aim to merge back as much as possible to other existing projects
    to increase the impact of what we do
